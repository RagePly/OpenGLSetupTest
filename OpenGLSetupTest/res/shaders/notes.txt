Fuck man

the way i understand things:

every step of the pipeline has a buffer
so vertex-array-buffer is one, and we can bind a buffer we created to it (which will then be active when we issue a drawcall

the makeContextCurrent function is the function that ensures that wha twe write in the file is outputed on the window.
each thread can only have one context, so when i set the different pointers from the main thread, openGL knows that it's the current threads buffers and programs im editing
